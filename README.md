# Frontend Task Wanclouds

This project is a simple React application built with Redux for state management and React Router for routing. It features two pages:

- **Form Page**: A form that allows users to input and save personal information.
- **Records Page**: A table that displays all saved records and provides an option to delete records.

## Features

- **Form with Validation**: Collects first name, last name, address, company, and telephone number.
- **Redux Store**: Uses Redux for state management to store and retrieve the data.
- **React Router**: Enables navigation between the form page and records page.
- **Delete Functionality**: Allows users to delete individual records from the records page.

## Libraries and Tools Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Redux**: For managing global state (the records).
- **React Router**: For handling navigation between pages.
- **Vite**: For faster build times and optimized development environment.
- **CSS**: For styling the components.
